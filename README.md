# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. We used the logistic regression algorithm on a cleaned heart disease dataset and achieved an accuracy of **85.25%**.

## Objective
To assist early diagnosis of heart-related conditions using predictive analytics, helping healthcare providers take preventive action.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
